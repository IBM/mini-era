# Mini-ERA: Simplified Version of the Main ERA Workload

This is a top-level driver for the Mini-ERA workload.

The Mini-ERA serves as a simplified but still representative workload for Colaborative Autonomous Vehicles, intended to drive the
EPOCHS full system design and development methodology in lieu of the full ERA workload.  As such, Mini-ERA is under continuous
development and extension.

Currently, Mini-ERA contains a number of kernels, and a decision module (used to update the autonomous vehicle's state).
The main kernels modules currently implemented are:
 - The "Radar" kernel, used to model the radar range-finding to the nearest obstacle in a given lane (usually the lane in which the autonomous vehicle is travelling)
 - The Viterbi Decoder kernel, which is used to decode messages received (presumably via Wi-Fi connection of some sort)
 - An H264 decoder, used to decode the input frames from the onboard camera in order to send them through the CV/CNN module
 - The CV/CNN (Computer Vision Object Recognition and Labeling) Module, which identifies the type of obstacle in a given lane, and

Recall that Min-ERA is a simplified representative workload set, so the code expresses the proper functionality for the kernels,
but does not implement a truly functional, full autonomous driving system; that is the domain of the larger ERA workload.

## System Requirements

Mini-ERA has been successfully built and executed using the following set-up:
 - Ubuntu 18.04
 - Python 3.0
 - Python 2.7
 
Ubuntu 16.04 platforms with older Python versions may also work but have not been tested.

*Note:* The CV CNN code requires clear delineation of Python 2 or Python 3, and modification of the Makefile to employ one or the other.  The rest of the python code is largely Python 2/3 agnostic.


## Installation and Execution
```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/mini-era.git
cd mini-era
cd cv/CNN_MIO_KERAS
python mio_dataset.py
```

This last step (`python mio_dataset.py`) has to be run **only once** to create test images as `.npy` files. Then:

### Build

A basic Mini-ERA build is straightforward, and requires only that one execute the default make action in the ```mini-era``` directory.  

```
make allclean
make
```

The ```make allclean``` is added just for surety that all code is re-built, i.e. in case there are odd time-stamps on the files, etc.  The ```make``` command should produce the ```main.exe``` target, which provides the basic means to run a Mini-ERA simulation.

### Usage
```

               :      2 = Long messages (1000 characters)
               :      3 = Max-sized messages (1500 characters)
```

#### Other Targets

Mini-ERA also supports a number of other targets.  One can build these individually, or can build them all and provision a variety of available run types.  The simplest means to build all targets is:
```
make all
```
If one is compiling on a system that does not include the full support for the CV/CNN (Keras, Tensorflow) model, then
one can restrict the build to only produce the Mini-ERA executables that do not utilize those resources.  This is referred to as
the C-subset, or the C-version Mini-ERA (as it does not includethe other languages used in defining the CNN model, etc.).  To build
this set of Mini-ERA executables, the easiest method is to build the "cver" target:
``` make cver
```


Mini-ERA supports two modes of execution: 
 - a trace-driven mode (the "classic" mode) where the simulation is driven by an input trace of obstacle positions per simulation time step 
 - a new, developing mode which uses on-board environment simulation to both introduce new obstacle vehicles and track the positions, etc. during simulation
This new simulation version is developed from the trace generation utility, and provides a greater range of behaviors to the autonomous vehicle ("red car") during a Mini-ERA run.

The ```make all``` command should compile a number of targets, including:
 - The default, trace-driven Mini-ERA:
   - main.exe : the trace-driven Mini-ERA
   - vmain.exe : trace-driven Mini-ERA in "verbose" mode (includes debug output)
 - The trace-driven Mini-ERA with no use of Keras/Python code:
   - cmain.exe : the trace-driven Mini-ERA with no use of Keras/Python code
   - fcmain.exe : the trace-driven Mini-ERA with no use of Keras/Python code and using hte "viterbi_flat" Viterbi implementation
   - gp_cmain.exe : the trace-driven Mini-ERA without CNN, and set up for ```gprof``` profiling
   - it-cmain.exe : the cmain.exe Mini-ERA with support for timing the execution of various elements (and report the timing)
   - it-fcmain.exe : the fcmain.exe Mini-ERA with support for timing the execution of various elements (and report the timing)
   - vcmain.exe : the trace-driven cmain.exe Mini-ERA in "verbose" mode, with no use of Keras/Python code 
   - vfcmain.exe : the trace-driven fcmain.exe Mini-ERA in "verbose" mode, with no use of Keras/Python code

   - vsim_main.exe : the simulation-mode Mini-ERA in "verbose" mode (includes debug output)

   - csim_main.exe : the simulation-mode Mini-ERA with no use of Keras/Python code
   - fcsim_main.exe : the simulation-mode Mini-ERA with no use of Keras/Python code, using the "viterbi_flat" Viterbi code
   - it-csim_main.exe : the csim_main.exe Mini-ERA with support for timing the execution of various elements (and report the timing)
   - it-fcsim_main.exe : the fcsim_main.exe Mini-ERA with support for timing the execution of various elements (and report the timing)
   - vcsim_main.exe : the simulation-mode Mini-ERA in "verbose" mode, with no use of Keras/Python code
   - vfcsim_main.exe : the simulation-mode Mini-ERA in "verbose" mode, with no use of Keras/Python code, using the "viterbi_flat" Viterbi code

### Execution (Example)
The usage for the trace-driven Mini-ERA and simulation-mode Mini-ERA differ slightly.  Here we will give two examples, one for each mode.

#### Trace Mode:

Trace-driven Mini-era requires the specification of the input trace (using -t <trace_file>) and also supports the specification of a message modeling behavior for the Viterbi kernel, using -v <N> (where N is an integer).  The corresponding behaviors are:

```
./main.exe -t <trace_name>     (e.g. traces/test_trace1.new)
```

By using the -v <N> behavior controls, one can simulate the Viterbi messaging work that could load the system when either operating with a single global (environmental) messsage model, with a pure swarm collaboration model (where each other nearby vehicle sends a message) and in a hybrid that includes both kinds of messaging.  The message length also allows one to consider the effect of larger and small message payload decoding on the overall Viterbi run-time impact.


#### Simulation Mode:

Trace-driven Mini-era requires the specification of the input trace (using -t <trace_file>) and also supports the specification of a message modeling behavior for the Viterbi kernel, using -v <N> (where N is an integer).  The corresponding behaviors are:

```
./sim_main.exe 
```

The simulation-mode usage is:
```
Usage: ./csim_main.exe <OPTIONS>
 OPTIONS:
    -h         : print this helpful usage info
    -o         : print the Visualizer output traace information during the run
    -R <file>  : defines the input Radar dictionary file <file> to use
    -V <file>  : defines the input Viterbi dictionary file <file> to use
    -C <file>  : defines the input CV/CNN dictionary file <file> to use
    -H <file>  : defines the input H264 dictionary file <file> to use
    -b         : Bypass (do not use) the H264 functions in this run.
    -s <N>     : Sets the max number of time steps to simulate
    -r <N>     : Sets the rand random number seed to N
    -A         : Allow obstacle vehciles in All lanes (otherwise not in left or right hazard lanes)
    -W <wfile> : defines the world environment parameters description file <wfile> to use
    -p <N>     : defines the plan-and-control repeat factor (calls per time step -- default is 1)
    -f <N>     : defines which Radar Dictionary Set is used for Critical FFT Tasks
               :      Each Set of Radar Dictionary Entries Can use a different sample size, etc.
    -n <N>     : defines number of Viterbi messages per time step behavior:
               :      0 = One message per time step
               :      1 = One message per obstacle per time step
               :      2 = One msg per obstacle + 1 per time step
    -v <N>     : defines Viterbi message size:
               :      0 = Short messages (4 characters)
               :      1 = Medium messages (500 characters)
               :      2 = Long messages (1000 characters)
               :      3 = Max-sized messages (1500 characters)
```

Note that in simulation mode, there is no option to specify a trace (the '-t' of trace-mode) as there is no need for or use of a trace.  There are four additional options in simulation-mode: the '-s' which indicates the number of time steps to simulate (which is analogous to the trace length) and '-r' which sets the seed value (and unsigned int) for the C ```rand()``` function used in the simulation.  Both modes support the '-v' and '-o' options.  

In the Simulation mode there is also a `-A` option, which allows the simulation to add obstacle vehicles to all five lanes of the highway.  This is allowable in the simulation mode because the autonomous vehicle ("red car") is allowed to alter speed, etc. in order to avoid collisions, which otherwise tend to require a clear lane in the trace mode.  It is possible, however, to run simulation mode in either the default 3-lanes of obstacle traffic (leaving the left-most and right-most free of obstacles) or in a five-lane obstacles mode by specifying the '-A' for "All lanes can contain obstacle vehicles."

Finally, there is the '-W' options which allows one to specify a "World Description File" which is used to define various parameters of the simulation used to decide elements like the probability of new obstacle vehicle arriving, their speeds, etc.  See the detailed description below.

### Parameter Dependence

The usage defines sets of command-line options, but there are some usage restrictions and comditions that must hold
in order to define a legal (i.e. functionally correct) execution. These are detialed here.

#### FFT Samples and FFT Dictionary

Mini-ERA defaults currenlty to a 16k-sample FFT, and to the ```traces/norm_radar_16k_dictionary.dfn``` radar dictionary file.
There are some additional radar dictionary files provided in the ```traces``` directory.  One of these contains multiple
complete Radar input sets, one for 1k-sample sand one for 16k-samples in the same dictionary (the ```norm_radar_all_dictionary.dfn```).
One can use this input dictionary, and then use the ```-f``` option to select input set 0 or 1
(where set 0 is the 1k-sample inputs and set 1 is the 16k-sample inputs).  Specification of an input parametere
value for ```-f``` which exceeds the number of sets in the dictionary file results in an error report.

The radar dictionary files and their descriptions:
 - ```norm_radar_16k_dictionary.dfn``` defines normalized inputs, etc. for a 16k-sample FFT 
 - ```norm_radar_01k_dictionary.dfn``` defines normalized inputs, etc. for a  1k-sample FFT
 - ```norm_radar_all_dictionary.dfn``` defines normalized inputs, etc. for a 1k-sample FFT set followed by a 16k-sample FFT 

Thus, legal combinations of the ```-f``` and ```-R``` options are:
 - ```-f 0 -R traces/norm_radar_16k_dictionary``` which is 16k normalized samples
 - ```-f 0 -R traces/norm_radar_01k_dictionary``` which is  1k normalized samples
 - ```-f 0 -R traces/norm_radar_all_dictionary``` which selects the  1k normalized samples set
 - ```-f 1 -R traces/norm_radar_all_dictionary``` which selects the 16k normalized samples set


## Status

The trace version currently uses an input trace to drive the Mini-ERA behaviors, and the computer-vision, Viterbi and radar ranging functionality in the underlying kernels. There are some example traces in the ```traces``` subdirectory.
 - ```test_trace1.new``` is a short trace (117 time steps) that illustrates the funciton of the Mini-ERA, is readable ASCII code, and fairly simple.
 - ```test_trace2.new``` is a slightly longer (1000 time steps) simple illustrative trace
 - ```tt00.new``` is a 5000 record illustrative trace
 - ```tt01.new``` is a 5000 record illustrative trace
 - ```tt02.new``` is a 5000 record trace that includes multiple obstacle vehicles per lane (at times)
 - ```tt03.new``` is a 5000 record trace that includes multiple obstacle vehicles per lane (at times)

There is an example trace (`test_trace.new`) to illustrate the function of the Mini-ERA, and a collection of dictionary files (e.g. `radar_dictionary.dfn`) which are used by the kernels in conjunction with the input trace to drive the proper kernel inputs (in response to the trace inputs).

Notes that all these traces are simple ASCII format, with one time step per line in the file.  One can create a sset trace
by taking the initial N lines of the file, e.g. to create a 500-time-step version of tt02.new one could use:

```
     head -n 500 traces/tt02.new > traces/tt02_0500.new
```

Currently our primary trace for analysis, testing, demos, etc. has been tt02.new (or a 100 or 500 time-step some sub-trace of that trace).


### Trace Format

The trace is a simple ASCII file. The general format of the trace file is a 3-tuple with one set of information per lane (left, center, right) representing information about the contents of that lane for that time-step. The general format of a trace entry is:

```
Xl:yl,Xm:ym,Xr:yr
```

where `X` is a character which identifies a type of obstacle object, and `y` is an unsigned integer representing a distance measure for that object. The `Xl` would be a character identifying an object in the Left lane, at distance `yl` while the `Xm` identifies an object in the `Middle` lane at distance `ym` and the `Xr` indicates an object in the `Right` lane at distance `yr`.  

The "world" in Mini-ERA is viewed as a 2-dimensional space of five-lane highway, where the lanes are arranged left-to-right and the distances are from position zero (which is effectively the back of the car) to some maximum value N which represents the farthest out objects can occur/be tracked.
The lanes are labeled left-to-right as:
 - Left-Hazard Lane
 - Left Lane
 - Middle Lane
 - Right Lane
 - Right-Hazard Lane
and obstacle vehicles are expected to operate only in the Left, Middle and Right lanes (in the trace-driven version)  or across all five lanes (in the simulation version).

<img src="/utils/mini_era.png" width="400">

In this implementation, the objects include:

```
  C - a car
  T - a truck
  P - a pedestrian
  B - a bike
  N - nothing
```

In concert, the distances currently implemented are values between 0 and 550 and represent some currently unspecified unit of distance (though in truth they correspond to the radar kernel's distance measures, which span roughly zero to 500 meters, where 550 represents "infinitely far away" or "no obstale detected"). 
The actual radar inputs (dictionary values) are currently "bucketized" into 50-unit increments, therefore the rada will report distances of 0, 50, 100, 150, ..., 500 or 550 (infinite) for any detected objects.
The following image illustrates how a specific scenario at a given point in time is could be encoded in a trace entry, assuming we are using 50-metere steps of distance (though the trace currently can specify non bucketized distances, e.g. 97, and these are 
converted to the equivalent (currently 50-meter) bucket at run time (e.g. by using ```floor(dist/50)```) when selecting the effective radar input.:

```
  Distance| Left | Cntr | Right|
  -------------------------------
  |  500  |      |      |      |
  |  450  |      |      |      |
  |  400  |      |  T   |      |
  |  350  |      |      |      |
  |  300  |  C   |      |      |
  |  250  |      |      |      |
  |  200  |      |      |      |
  |  150  |      |      |      |
  |  100  |      |      |  P   |
  |   50  |      |      |      |
  |    0  |      |      |      |

Corresponding trace entry:  C:300,T:400,P:100 
```

## Dictionary Files

Each kernel also uses a dictionary which translates conditions (e.g. the distance of an object) into the appropriate inputs for the underlying kernel. Each dictionary file has a statically-defined name (for now) and a similar encoding:

```
   <n> = number of dictionary entries (message types)
```

For each dictionary entry:

```
   <kernel-specific input parameters>
```

The following sections lay out the specific dictionary file formats per kernel.


### The Viterbi Dictionary Format

This file describes the Viterbi dictionary format, as defined in `vit_dictionary.dfn`.

The trace dictionary is defined as follows:

```
   <n> = number of dictionary entries (message types)
```

For each dictionary entry:

```
   n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 : OFDM parms: 
   m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 : FRAME parms:
   x1 x2 x3 ...   : The message bits (input to decode routine)
```

```
4   	              - There are 4 messages in the dictionary
1 48 24 0 13  	    - The OFDM parameters for the first message (which is "Msg0")
32 12 10 576 288    - The FRAME parameters for the first message (which is "Msg0")
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ... - The input bits for the first message (last bit ENDs this dictionary entry)
1 48 24 0 13  	    - The OFDM parameters for the second message (which is "Msg1")
32 12 10 576 288    - The FRAME parameters for the second message (which is "Msg1")
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ... - The input bits for the second message (last bit ENDs this dictionary entry)
...
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ... - The input bits for the fourth message (last bit ENDs this and all dictionary entries)
```
 
### The Radar Dictionary Format

This file describes the Radar dictionary format, as defined in `radar_dictionary.dfn`.

The trace dictionary is defined as follows:

```
<S> <E>     - Number of dictionary Sets (```S```) and Entries per Set (```E```)
<L>         - The Log2 of the number of samples (```L```) per entry in the set
<I> <L> <D> - the ID of this entry (```I```), Log2 Samples (```L```) for this entry, ) and Distance (```D```) it represents
<f>         - These are the input data values (float format)
<f>         - There are (```1<<L```) or ```2^L``` per dictionary entry in this set
...
<f>
<I> <L> <D> - the ID of this entry (```I```), Log2 Samples (```L```) for this entry, ) and Distance (```D```) it represents
...
...
<f>
<L>         - The Log2 of the number of samples (```L```) per entry in the next set
<I> <L> <D> - the ID of this entry (```I```), Log2 Samples (```L```) for this entry, ) and Distance (```D```) it represents
...
```

### The CV Dictionary Format

This version of the Mini-ERA does not use or require a CV CNN Dictionary file.  Note that this may change as we move forward, but currently the dictionary functionality is incorporated into the Python CV CNN kernel code.


### The H264 Dictionary Format

This version of the Mini-ERA does not use or require an H264 Dictionary file (yet).  There is provision in place to utilize one in the future.


## More Details, Additional Utilities, etc. 

The Mini-ERA applications currently consists of four major components:

 - The main Mini-ERA driver (scaffolding)
 - The CV kernel
 - The Viterbi kernel
 - The Radar kernel

Each kernel is implemented in a separate subdirectory space, consistent with their name/function (e.g. Viterbi is in `viterbi`, etc.). Most of the Mini-ERA is implemented in standard C code using GCC compilation. The CV CNN code, however, is a Keras implementation of a CNN and requires the system suport Keras python input, etc.

## Simulation Mode World Description File

The world description file is similar to a dictionary file in that it defines aspects of the world (or environment) of the simulation mode run.  The general format is an ASCII file with keywords and values; a default_world.desc file is provided:
```
MAX_OBJECT_SIZE 50.0

   - ```BIKE SPEED 20 PROB 100``` : This defines the third bike speed -- else if rand < PROB then speed will be SPEED, i.e. (100 - 95) = 5% of bikes will have speed 20
 - ```NUM_PERSON_SPEEDS 2``` : This defines the number of possible speeds an obstacle person can have (when it is created at the top of a lane)
   - ```PERSON SPEED 15 PROB 50``` : This defines the first person speed -- if rand in [0,99] < PROB then speed will be SPEED, i.e. 50% of people will have speed 15
   - ```PERSON SPEED 10 PROB 100``` : This defines the second person speed -- else if rand < PROB then speed will be SPEED, i.e. (100 - 50) = 50% of people will have speed 10
 - ```MY_CAR GOAL SPEED 50.0``` : This defines the goal speed for the red car (the autonomous vehicle); this is the speed that the car will try to maintain; shoudl it slow down (to avoid collisions) it will try to speed up to this goal speed again (when it is deemed safe to do so)
 - ```MY_CAR ACCEL RATE 15.0``` : This defines the rate (delta-speed) at which the red car can accelerate (speed up) to regain the goal speed
 - ```MY_CAR DECEL RATE 15.0``` : This defines the rate (delta-speed) at which the red car can brake (or slow down) to avoid collisions
 - ```MY_CAR LANE 2 SPEED 50``` : This defines the initial state of the red car; alterations should not matter much as the car will tend to move to the goal speed and center lane at all times anyway.

When one runs Mini-ERA in simulation-mode, the beginning of the run will output the World Description File contents (as per the example ```default_world.desc``` above) into the output of the run (as part of the header information).  This can then be used to track which options were used to produce the simulation run. 



## Installation and Building

To install the Mini-ERA workload, clone the git repository:

```
  git clone https://github.com/IBM/mini-era
  cd mini-era/cv/CNN_MIO_KERAS
  export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`  (path_to_mini_era/cv/CNN_MIO_KERAS)
  python mio_dataset.py
```

To build Mini-ERA::

```
  cd mini-era
  make all
```
This will build all the necessary programs; the mini-era main program(s), the
utilities programs, etc. Some of these can be built independently, e.g. the
trace generator includes compile-time parameters (at present) and thus might
need to be recompiled to change the output trace.

To build the trace-generation program:

```
  cd utils
  make tracegen
```

To generate an input trace:
```
  ./tracegen > <target_trace_file>
```

Note that some example traces have been provided, in the traces directory.
The '''test_trace1.new''' is a short trace, and the
'''tt00.new''' and '''tt01.new''' and '''tt02.new''' files are longer example traces.

## Invocation and Usage

The main mini-era program is invoked using the program main.exe, but there is also a debugging (verbose) version named vmain.exe.
The invocation also requires an input trace file to be specifed:
```
  main.exe -t traces/test_trace1.new
```

The visualizer can also be used to visualize the operation of the simulation.  The visualizer sits in the visualizer subdirectory, and currently requires its own version of the trace to operate. Please see the visualizer README.md file in the visualizer subdirectory.

To drive the visualizer, one needs to produce a Visualizer trace.  The mini-era program can produce these traces.  Currently, the method to generate a Visualizer input trace from a Mini-ERA run (itself in this case driven by a Mini-ERA input trace) is to enable the "-o" output visualizer information option:
```
  ./main.exe -t traces/test_trace1.new -o > visualizer/traces/viz_tet_trace1.new
```

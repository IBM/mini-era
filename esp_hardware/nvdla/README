Follow all the steps when a bit stream needs to be generated. If not, i.e. when there are no changes to the HW (ip folder in ~/repos/esp/third_party/accelerators/dma64/NV_NVDLA/ip), Do steps 2,4,6,7,8,9 in order. 


1. Generate an instance with ariane + NVDLA (1) with 
make esp-xconfig
 
2. replace the contents of ~/repos/esp/third-party/accelerators/dma64/NV_NVDLA/sw/umd/apps/runtime with the contents of next_ver/nvdla
from the mini-era repo. Make sure you copy everything except next_ver/nvdla/NV_NVDLA

3.In folder ~/repos/esp/socs/profpga-xc7v2000t
make dist-clean 
make NV_NVDLA-clean
make linux -j8

4. make NV_NVDLA

5. Generate bitstream (This step needs to be done only the very first time. No need to do this when changing anything in umd or kmd, unless the RTL in ip changes. 
make vivado-syn
. 
6. make linux -j8
This step populates the folder ~/repos/esp/socs/profpga-xc7v2000t/sysroot/root  with libruntime.so

7. Copy the contents of next_ver/nvdla/NV_NVDLA to ~/repos/esp/socs/profpga-xc7v2000t/sysroot/root/NV_NVDLA except libruntime.so

8. In folder ~/repos/esp/socs/profpga-xc7v2000t
make fpga-run-linux

9. On espdev, go to folder NV_NVDLA 
./nvdla_runtime -t traces/tt02_05.new
